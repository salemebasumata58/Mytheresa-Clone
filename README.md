# Clone of MYTHERESA [https://www.mytheresa.com/]

Mytheresa is a German e-commerce luxury fashion company. It is a lifestyle fashion brand that lets their customers have a hassle-free and convenient online shopping experience.As part of our project, we had to replicate the landing page, login/sign up, and the product pages, along with the ability to wishlist an item, add an item to the cart, and checkout.
